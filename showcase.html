						Emails and automations were created around central themes of Pain and Inflammation Relief, Fitness, Performance and Recovery, Sleep and Circadian Rhythm, Skin and Beauty.

						These were then built on with an influencer strategy, that further adapted more personalized content based on the individual profile of the recipient.

						<p>In less than a year, Joovv went from having little email revenue to over half of all their revenue being attributed to email marketing. </p>

						<p>There is no disputing the success of discounting and offers when it comes to online retail. It’s still one of the most successful tactics to drive sales. The challenge for serious merchants is how to do this while driving profitable revenue growth for their business at the same time.</p>

						<p>Reducing customer acquisition costs, improving conversion rates and growing lifetime value are all areas where email marketing can help. </p>

						<p>But it’s the personalization of email content and the timing of it being sent, relevant to their position in the journey that makes email so valuable. When you align this with a data-led understanding of each customer, you can add genuine value to their experience with your brand and charge a premium price to do so. </p>

						<p>It’s why Joovv has never discounted and their email strategy has been so successful.</p>
